Star Citizen Skin for Steam v0.2
============================

###IMPORTANT
It is important that you install ALL the fonts in the fonts folder or this skin will not look as intended. It's the original font used for Star Citizen :)

##Installing

1. Extract the files in the ZIP folder to:
	- Windows: `Program Files (x86)/Steam/skins`
	- Mac: right-click `Steam.app` and choose `show package contents` then go to - `/Contents/MacOS/skins`
	- Linux: `~/.local/share/Steam/skins/`
2. You should also go ahead and install all of the fonts that are in the `fonts - INSTALL ME FIRST!` folder.
	- Windows: Right-Click the font file and choose "Install".
	- Mac: Double-Click the font file. Click "Install".
	- Linux: If a graphical font viewer is installed on your system you will most likely be able to install the fonts easily using that program. Otherwise you need to “install” the fonts manually by copying them to `/usr/share/fonts` (to install them system-wide) or `~/.fonts` (to install them only for the current user) and executing `fc-cache -fv` in a terminal.
3. Open up Steam then open up the Steam Settings Window. Click on the Interface tab, and under the option that says "Select the skin you wish Steam to use (requires Steam to restart)", click on the dropdown, and select "StarCitizen for Steam".
4. Now restart the Steam client. The skin should now be applied.

2. Paste the content into `SCS-for-Steam`
3. Confirm overriding the existing files

Orbitron font
=============
_by [Matt McInerney](http://pixelspread.com)_

Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. It features four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), a stylistic alternative, small caps, and a ton of alternate glyphs. 

Orbitron was designed so that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you have may noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, space station signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future.
